# RPG elements
This game will contain several RPG elements that change the dynamics of the peggle board.

## Stats
The player will have several stats. These aren't settled yet but could include such stats as:
- Predictive path length (should start pretty short)
- Damage dealt on hit (random between a min and max damage)
  - Damage types for resistance/weakness and build variety?
- HP/balls/whatever lets the player survive longer
- Ball size? Is bigger better or worse? Circumstantial?
- Item find chance/quantity/quality?
- Ability to see into adjacent rooms?
- Special effects on hit?
  - Poison/bleed: Deals damage to inflicted target every time the ball is launched, runs out after x triggers
  - Slow/cripple: Makes the peg larger, slows it down if it's moving
- Range/reach: Hit one or more nearby pegs with damage x times per second, can vary a lot. Arrow would target a single peg, cyclone or damage aura would hit everything within range, very powerful

## Classes?
Not sure if this makes sense but you could pick your class at the beginning, something like
- Man-at-arms: High damage on hit, no range, low predictive path length
- Ranger: Low damage on hit, slightly higher damage ranged attack, medium predictive path length
- Sorcerer: Low damage on hit, weird on-hit/ranged effects on pegs maybe more effects on combos?, high predictive path length
- Rogue: Medium damage on hit, low damage ranged attack, high predictive path length, increased item find?
Maybe the defining class factor other than starting stats could be what happens on combo? Would make each class feel distinct on gameplay
